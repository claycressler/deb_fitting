## Compute the correlation between growth and reproduction in the
## following way: (1) numerically simulate the best fit parameter
## values; (2) fit a von Bertalanffy model to the growth trajectory
## using NLS to estimate the produce Linf*k; (3) compute the mean
## daily egg rate; (4) compute the correlation between all of the
## individual Linf*k measurements and the individual mean daily egg
## rate measurements.

## Compute an elasticity dCorr/dParams by adjusting the best-fit
## parameters by a fixed amount and computing how much this changes
## the correlation.
