## Load the code for performing trajectory matching

## Load Cat's data
x <- read.csv("Cat_data/uninfected_growth_reproduction.csv")
data <- x[1:103,1:3]

## I need to think carefully about how to deal with maturation. The DEB model will allow individuals to reproduce immediately. I could treat size at maturity as a parameter to be estimated. Or I could simply say, for each individual, that size at maturity is whatever size reproduction was first observed.
